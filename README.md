### 🚀 About Me

I am a **Product Manager** bridging the gap between complex AI architectures and user-centric business value. I specialize in translating "rare expertise" technologies—like **Autonomous Agents, RAG, and MLOps**—into scalable, market-ready products.

I don't just write code; I build **product visions**. My background in engineering allows me to speak the language of developers, while my strategic focus ensures we ship the *right* products that solve real user problems.

### 🔥 Why Hire Me?
* **Bridge the Gap:** I can debate architecture trade-offs with engineers in the morning and present ROI analysis to executives in the afternoon.
* **Data-Fluent:** I don't guess; I query. I use SQL and Python to pull my own data for decision-making.
* **AI-Native:** I understand the *capabilities and limitations* of current AI models, preventing "AI hype" features that don't solve real problems.
